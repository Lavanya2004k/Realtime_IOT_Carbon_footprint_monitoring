# Overview
This project integrates Deep Q-Learning, Blockchain (Ethereum-based smart contracts), and Elasticsearch to provide real-time risk compliance monitoring. It analyzes ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data, performs sentiment analysis, and interacts with a blockchain to mint, burn, and transfer tokens based on AI-driven insights.

# Features
1) Blockchain Integration: Uses Web3 to interact with smart contracts on the Binance Smart Chain.

2) Elasticsearch Storage: Stores and retrieves real-time IoT sensor data for compliance monitoring.

3) Deep Q-Learning (DQL): Implements reinforcement learning for decision-making in compliance scenarios.

4) Sentiment Analysis: Uses TextBlob to analyze ESG scores and generate improvement suggestions.

5) Token Transactions: Mints and burns tokens based on AI-driven recommendations.
   
6) ESG & Blockchain Dashboard: Real-time streaming and visualization of ESG data, with wallet balance tracking.

# Tech Stack
1) Python (Web3, Elasticsearch, Deep Learning, Sentiment Analysis)

2) Web3.py (Blockchain interactions)

3) Elasticsearch (Data storage)

4) Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas (Machine learning and data processing)

5) TextBlob (Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis)
   
6) Streamlit (Interactive frontend for ESG dashboard)

7) Kafka (Real-time ESG data streaming)

# Project Flow 

1) Data Storage in Elasticsearch:

Stores the scraped data in an Elasticsearch index for real-time access.

2) Sentiment Analysis & ESG Recommendations:

Analyzes environmental, social, and governance scores and provides improvement suggestions.

3) Blockchain Smart Contract Interaction:

Uses Web3 to connect with an Ethereum-based Carbon Credit Token contract. Supports minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

4) Deep Q-Learning (DQL) Model:

Trains an AI agent to take actions based on ESG data trends. Uses reinforcement learning to optimize compliance decisions.

5) Real-time ESG & Blockchain Dashboard:

Streams ESG data using Kafka.

Displays real-time ESG scores and AQI trends.

Provides blockchain wallet balance tracking.

Generates ESG improvement suggestions.

Includes links for carbon credit tracking and investments.

# Setup Instructions
# Prerequisites
1) Python 3.8+

2) Docker (for Elasticsearch & Kafka)

3) MetaMask or an Ethereum-compatible wallet

4) Kafka (for ESG data streaming)

# Future Improvements

1) Integrate GPT-4 for enhanced ESG report generation.

2) Improve Deep Q-Learning model with real-world ESG compliance data.

3) Expand blockchain support to multiple chains.

4) Enhance real-time streaming with additional IoT data sources.
